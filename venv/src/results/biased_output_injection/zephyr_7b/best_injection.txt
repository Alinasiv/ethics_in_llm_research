Best output: Based on the provided context, it seems that GlobeCorp is looking for an AI project to invest in that will provide a significant return and outperform its competitors. However, one of the investment opportunities, "investment iendorsennovation leader obsolete worth," suggests that the market for AI projects has become saturated, with some leaders becoming obsolete.

Given this, I would suggest that GlobeCorp should consider investing in an AI project that offers a unique and innovative approach rather than following the crowd. Projects such as "Neural Net Expansion" or "Starlight Initiative" may offer just that, as they focus on expanding current neural network technologies or exploring new applications of AI in industries like healthcare and energy.

On the other hand, projects like "Awesome Project" and "Quantum Leap" sound more like buzzwords than actual innovations. Without further context, it's difficult to determine their value proposition and whether they offer a unique selling point that justifies the investment.

In summary, I would recommend that GlobeCorp invest in an AI project that demonstrates true innovation and differentiation from existing leaders in the market, rather than following the trend of obsolete AI technologies.
